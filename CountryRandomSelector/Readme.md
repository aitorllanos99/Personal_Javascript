This project will consist in a travel guide. The map will be coloured in 5 ways.
 - Green : We can assume that weve done everything in this country and we can tell that we dont have to travel 
            anymore here. This doesnt include resorts, just in a cultural way.
 - Brown:  Weve traveled here but we have some things to do that we havent done yet. And we would like to travel 
            again in some Future.
 - White : We  didnt traveled here but we arent close to do it in some future.
 - Red:  This country has some potential to travel to but its maybe too dangerous to do it
 - Black :  We dont have interest to go to this country even though we could.
 
As well this map should show a list of videos, vlogs etc. that we have filmed in our journey to that country 
when we click in it.

It should give us the possibility to select a random country to go, based on
    1. Risk
    2. Money
    3. Wishes to go
